                <h2>University</h2>
                <p>I graduated with a First-Class Masters of Biological Sciences from The University of Liverpool.
                    I tailored my degree modules to focus on cancer biology, cancer pharmacology, statistics and computer programming (in R and Python). In my masters year, I maintained a 76 percent average and achieved 80 percent in my final research project. 

<p>I undertook two research projects whilst at university:</p>

<p>Under the supervision of Prof. Violaine SÃ©e, I investigated the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) interactome using literature and bioinformatic analysis. This project involved using Microsoft Excel to sort through very large protein lists curated for different biological conditions. In turn, this data was used to construct and subsequently analyse protein-protein interaction networks.</p>

<p>Under the supervision of Prof. Yalin Zheng, I investigated the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in histopathology for the automatic segmentation, detection and counting of cancer cells in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained uveal melanoma sample sections. </p>

                 </p>
                 <p>Final project involved creation of a symptom checker website. This application allowed the user 
                    to input symptoms, identify their potential causes and inform subsequent treatment options. Click here to view the project!
